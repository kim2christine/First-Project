        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        <p>
         After a few days, Doah was tired and needed to freshen up.  Christine decided to give him the 
       
        <b>ultimate</b> 
        <i>makeover!</i> Here are some ideas for how you can spruce up your violin. <br>
        First things first. If the sound coming from your violin sounds dull, it might be a good idea 
        to <b>change the strings</b>. <br>
         There are many brands to choose from <br>
         but the strings Christine decided to go with are <small>Evah Pirazzi Gold Strings</small>. <br>
         To change the strings, focus on removing AND replacing one string at a time. <br>
        Make sure not to remove all the strings simultaneously, because the other three strings need to have enough 
        pressure to keep the bridge from collapsing <br>
         I like to start with the A string, then G string, then D string, and save the E string (the most fragile) for last. <br>
         And THAT is how Doah got his first little <i>upgrade</i>.

          With his new strings, <b>Shenandoah</b> sounded beautiful <br>
          However, Christine wanted him to look as beautiful as he sounded  <br>
          She decided to give him a little makeover by: <br>
      </p>
          <ul>
              <li>Wiping off All Rosin Dust from the fingerboard</li>
              <li>Applying Varnish </li>
              <li>Applying Fresh Rosin to the bow</li>
          </ul>

       <h2 id="third">Chapter 3</h2>
       <p>After getting all of the items needed for the trip, <br>
        Christine made the trip home.  As soon as she got home, <br>
        she got out her laptop and wanted to share with the world her new violin! <br>
        First she went to her mom, "Mom do you want to hear my new violin?" <br>
        Then, she went to her friends, "Do you want to hear my new violin?" <br>
        </p>

        <p> However, this method was <i>not</i> quick enough!  <br>
        Christine wanted to give access to whoever needed <b>encouragement</b> <br>
        from the violin's magical powers. <br>
        Thus, she made a <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoSojgWUOCPzz7_4JfyYRQ > channel</a> 
         to share with the world! <br>
