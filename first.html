         This is
        <b>so</b> 
        <i>cool!</i> that I am getting to share the story of how I got my violin! <br>
         His name is Doah- short for <b>Shenandoah</b>. <br>
         A long time ago, mommy Christine was looking for a new violin <br>
         and she came  across a magical forest in the <small>Shenandoah Valley</small>. <br>
         There! She came across the most beautiful sound coming from a lone violin. <br>
         An invisible angel must have been playing it, for there was noone else around. <br>
         The violin came floating to her, like a wand picking a wizard, <br>
         and THAT is how Christine got her <i>first violin</i>.

      <h2 class="custom">Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>
          Christine and her new violin named <b>Shenandoah</b> decided to head back home to Alexandria <br>
          However, Christine realized she was running short on supplies.  <br>
          In order to make it back, she made a list of the items she needed: <br>
      </p>
          <ul>
              <li>bread</li>
              <li>cheese</li>
              <li>milk</li>
              <li>jam</li>
          </ul>

        <p> 
            To the <a href  = "file:///Users/christine/ProjectIT/hello/Projects/grocerystore.html" > store </a> we go!
        </p>
       <hr>

       <h2 id="third">Chapter 3</h2>
       <p>After getting all of the items needed for the trip, <br>
        Christine made the trip home.  As soon as she got home, <br>
        she got out her laptop and wanted to share with the world her new violin! <br>
        First she went to her mom, "Mom do you want to hear my new violin?" <br>
        Then, she went to her friends, "Do you want to hear my new violin?" <br>
        </p>

        <p> However, this method was <i>not</i> quick enough!  <br>
        Christine wanted to give access to whoever needed <b>encouragement</b> <br>
        from the violin's magical powers. <br>
        Thus, she made a <a href = https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoSojgWUOCPzz7_4JfyYRQ > channel</a> 
         to share with the world! <br>
